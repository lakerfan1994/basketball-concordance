// So the way its going to work just so i have it for future reference is that the signup and login buttons will trigger a 
// dispatch that changes a signup variable in the reducer to true to indicate im trying to either sign up or log in. This in the 
//rerendering will allow me to put a new if statement in the homepage tthat will display this object or the signup object, based
//on whether im trying to log in or not. So when you come back, work on fleshing out the signin and login pages
